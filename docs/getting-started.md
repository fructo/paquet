# Getting started

:wave: Hi! Here is how you can add your app to Paquet. Adding a new app
is done by submiting an issue on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/notangelmario/paquet).

## Using `manifest.json` (wip)

You can use your `manifest.json` or `site.webmanifest` to specify the app listing
details.

Here are the keys we use when displaying your app listing on Paquet:

* `name`
* `description`
* `categories`
* `icons`
* `screenshots` (soon)

Also we use some non-standard keys to specify additional details:

* `paquet_features`
* `paquet_author_id`

You can find more about manifest keys on the [manifest documentation](/docs/manifest.md)
